## Join Blend

Ready to sing your heart out and join a tight-knit group of fun-loving folx who share your passion? Blend Vocal Association of Calgary is a vibrant treble choir, holding auditions for our upcoming season!  We perform a wide variety of music, from folk and jazz to contemporary, rock and pop under the direction of our Music Director, Réjean Campbell.

We're specifically looking for alto voices to round out our sound. If you're a lower treble singer who has a great sense of humor, and is ready to create some beautiful music with us, we want to hear from you!

## Audition Details

**When:** Thursday, September 4th, 7:00 PM–9:00 PM

**Where:** Southwest Calgary (exact location provided upon booking)

## What we're looking for

**Vocal Ability:** Be prepared to sing a solo piece that shows off your vocal range and style. We love jazz, musical theatre, and pop, so a song from one of these genres would be perfect. Please bring an accompaniment track with you.

**Harmony Skills:** We'll be checking your ability to hold your own in a group and blend with other voices.

**Sight-Singing:** You'll be asked to demonstrate your ability to read music and sight-sing. A bit rusty? That's totally ok! A willingness to try it out, and commitment to learn your assigned part is all we ask!

## Commitment

**Rehearsals & Performances:** Rehearsals are Thursdays, 6:45 PM–9:00 PM in Southwest Calgary, with our first rehearsal on Thursday, September 11th. We perform a full program for both our fall and spring seasons, which we learn and memorize. Our winter concert is tentatively scheduled for Friday, December 19th, with other opportunities throughout the year.

**Workshops:** We also hold two six-hour weekend workshops per season to polish our sound and have fun together.

**Volunteer Involvement:** As a member, you'll be required to join a committee and contribute to the choir's success through volunteer efforts in areas like fundraising, concert planning, or other organizational tasks.
