**Blend Vocal Association of Calgary** is a vibrant auditioned treble choir focused on connection, growth, and great music. Founded with the vision of creating exceptional musical experiences through collaboration and dedication, we bring together talented singers who share a passion for vocal excellence.

We perform a wide variety of music, from folk and jazz to contemporary, rock and pop, creating beautiful harmonies and meaningful connections through song. Our diverse repertoire challenges our members while delighting audiences with fresh interpretations of beloved classics and exciting new arrangements.

## 🎵 Who We Are

This choir is perfect for singers with musical experience who want a group that takes learning seriously while still having fun. We value both musical excellence and the joy of making music together. Our members come from all walks of life, united by their love of singing and commitment to creating something beautiful as a collective.

We rehearse weekly in a supportive environment where every voice matters. Whether you're a seasoned performer or someone returning to choral music after a break, you'll find a welcoming community that encourages growth and celebrates individual contributions to our shared sound.
