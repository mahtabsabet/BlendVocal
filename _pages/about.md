**Réjean Campbell** s a conductor, educator, singer, and music director who hails from Calgary, Alberta. With nearly two decades of musical performance and direction to his credit, Réjean focuses his musical leadership activities on building relationships within his groups to foster a culture of trust, growth and collaboration. His efforts have earned him nominations for a Calgary Theatre Critic’s Award (Fiddler on the Roof, Painted Fish Performing Arts Society) and multiple Calgary-ACTS CAT Awards (e.g. Beauty and the Beast, Painted Fish Performing Arts Society). Réjean is Artistic Director of Blend Vocal and the Big Rock Singers, and holds ongoing educator positions at Storybook Theatre’s Theatre School, Morpheus Theatre’s G&S Junior Theatre School, Chinook School of Music, and Mount Royal Conservatory. He is a long-standing member of the Calgary Opera Chorus, and performs regularly with several professional and semi-professional choirs and orchestras. Mr. Campbell’s conducting mentors include Dr. Timothy Shantz (Artistic Director of the Juno Award-nominated Luminous Voices), Kenneth Kiesler (UofMichigan), and Dr. Mark Sirett (Member of the Order of Canada). When not making music, Réjean loves to ski, hike, and rock climb in the Canadian Rockies.
