**Réjean Campbell** is a conductor, educator, singer, and music director with two decades of musical performance and direction to his credit. Réjean focuses his musical leadership activities on building relationships within his groups to foster a culture of trust, growth and collaboration. His efforts have earned him nominations for a Calgary Theatre Critic’s Award (Fiddler on the Roof, Painted Fish Performing Arts Society) and multiple Calgary-ACTS CAT Awards (e.g. Beauty and the Beast, Painted Fish Performing Arts Society). In addition to his role at Blend Vocal, Rejean is Artistic Director of Okotoks' Big Rock Singers and holds ongoing educator positions at The Calgary Boys' Choir, Chinook School of Music, Morpheus Theatre’s G&S Junior Theatre School, Storybook Theatre’s Theatre School, and Mount Royal Conservatory. He is a long-standing member of the Calgary Opera Chorus, and performs regularly with several professional and semi-professional choirs and orchestras. Mr. Campbell earned a BMus from Queen's University and studied conducting with Dr. Timothy Shantz (Artistic Director of the Juno Award-nominated Luminous Voices), Kenneth Kiesler (UofMichigan), and Dr. Mark Sirett (Member of the Order of Canada). When not making music, Réjean loves to ski, hike, and rock climb in the Canadian Rockies.
